# Udacity Google Deep Learning Assigments
Here are my version of comleted Assigments for [Deep learning by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730).

## Framework:
- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - huge librarary for data science and computations/visalisations in general.
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) - Google's framework for machine learning.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) -  is a high-level API for neural networks, in my case it works with Tensorflow backends.
## Installation

Anaconda for python 2.7:
```sh
$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Anaconda2-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh 
```

Virtual enviroment of anaconda:
```sh
$ source anaconda2/bin/activate 
```

Installation Tensorflow:

```sh
$ conda install tensorflow-gpu
```
(GPU version of Tensorflow depends on [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (currently 8.0), [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) )

Installation of Keras:
```sh
$ conda install keras
````
Setting up Tesorflow backend: [instruction](https://keras.io/backend/).
